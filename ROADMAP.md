# Roadmap — xpm Package Manager

> Rust-based package manager for the 'X' distribution (Arch Linux-based).

## Phase 6 · Security and Verification <!-- phase:phase-6:security -->

- [ ] Implement OpenPGP signature verification (#26)
  - [ ] Verify detached .sig files via sequoia-openpgp (pure Rust)

## Phase 7 · Transactions and System Management <!-- phase:phase-7:transactions -->

- [ ] Implement transaction engine (#31)
  - [ ] Plan, prepare and commit install/remove/upgrade operations
